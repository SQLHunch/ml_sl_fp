Supervised Learning Analysis Project


Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for my final project, focusing on identifying and solving a Supervised Learning problem through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model analysis. The project aims to apply various machine learning techniques to a selected dataset to predict outcomes accurately.

- AID_analysis_model.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, including data cleaning, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- The data for the project will be downloaded via URL.
- requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

I am using Anaconda, with ipykernel 3.
