Supervised Learning Analysis Project


Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for my final project, focusing on identifying and solving a Supervised Learning problem through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model analysis. The project aims to apply various machine learning techniques to a selected dataset to predict outcomes accurately.


Contents

- AID_analysis_model.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, including data cleaning, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- There is no data file, since the data for the project will be read via URL.
- requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

I am using Anaconda, with ipykernel 3.


Project Structure

The notebook includes the following sections:

Introduction: Overview of the dataset used for the project.

Data Loading: Importing the dataset into the notebook.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and quantitative analysis to understand the data better.

Feature Engineering: Modifying or creating new features to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Comparing different models to choose the best performer.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the chosen model(s) using appropriate metrics.
Conclusion: Summary of the findings and potential steps for future work.
